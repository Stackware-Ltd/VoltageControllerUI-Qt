# Raspberry Pi PWM Project

This repository contains the complete source code for the PWM-based project developed for Raspberry Pi 4.

## üìå Overview

- Outputs **PWM signal on GPIO19**, which corresponds to **Physical Pin 35** on Raspberry Pi 4.
- Designed to run inside a **Python virtual environment** to ensure clean dependency management.
- Code is modular and ready for deployment on embedded systems.

## üß∞ Requirements

- Raspberry Pi 4 with Raspberry Pi OS installed
- Python 3.7 or above
- GPIO access permissions (typically requires root or `gpio` group)
- Git

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions
